  Within the Dnipropetrovsk Metropolitan area the population is about 1,004,000[6] to 1,360,000[7] people.\
  A vital industrial centre of Ukraine, Dnipropetrovsk was one of the key centres of the nuclear, arms, and space industries of the Soviet Union. In particular, it is home to the Yuzhmash, a major space and ballistic missile design bureau and manufacturer. Because of its military industry, Dnipropetrovsk was a closed city[8] until the 1990s.\
